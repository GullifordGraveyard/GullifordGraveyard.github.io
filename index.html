          The Gulliford Burial Ground is a dissenters' burial ground managed by both Lympstone and Woodbury Parish
          councils as it is situated on the boundary of both parishes and is important to the history of both.
          <br><br>
          The Friends of Gulliford Burial Ground has been set up by local residents who love the site as a beautiful and
          tranquil place to visit and also to preserve the history and heritage of the site. It has created an avenue
          for the Parish councils to get the volunteer helpers it needs to keep the site in good repair though gardening
          working parties and fundraising events.
          <br><br>
          Adverse weather conditions and lack of funds has lead to the burial ground's walls needing urgent repair. The
          graves also need to be repaired and maintained and we hope that we can now move forward to fundraise in order
          to do these urgent repairs and preserve this historical site for the next generation of parishioners.
        </p>

        <h2>The History of Gulliford Burial Ground</h2>

        Gulliford Burial Ground lies in Meetings Lane (reference to the Meeting House) and the top of Strawberry Hill,
        Lympstone.<br><br> A Presbyterian and later Unitarian site going back to the 17th century to a time of religious
        upheaval and risk of imprisonment to those not toeing the religious line. The first chapel was built in 1687,
        the band of dissenters grow made up by the new middle classes to humbler locals from Lympstone, Woodbury,
        Ebford, Exmouth & the surrounding areas, often with a dozen carriages parked outside, not an easy journey on
        unmade roads. <br><br>A violent riot broke out at one time, entering the chapel and smashing windows reminding
        the congregation of the risk of worshipping outside the established church. In 1774 a further plot of land was
        donated to extend the site for a second larger chapel to be built to replace the original chapel, which was now
        too small for the extra congregation. A ruling was make at the time that the new meeting house must not be used
        as a burying place for the dead with all burials performed in the graveyard (thence the lack of headstones at
        the back of the site today). Yearly donations from the congregation funded the site, Thomas Smith (Queen Anne
        House, Lympstone) gave £2 & Joseph Nutt of Lympstone gave 4 shillings in 1733. <br><br>In 1786 it was decided
        that each person should pay two shillings a year for a pew, records show that some people also paid for their
        servant’s seating, as well as shares bought by the trustee in the South Sea Stock. This paid for the salary of
        the Minister & the building up keep. <br><br>In 1853, the cost of a marriage for a subscriber to the chapel was,
        10s 6d for the Minister, 2s each for the Clerk & Sexton. Baptism was 1s for the Minister, 9d for both the Clerk
        & Seaton. Burial fee resulting in the Minister getting £1 1s, Clerk & Sexton each getting 2s 6d, permission for
        a common grave 10s 6d, permission for a headstone 10s 6d and permission for a tomb with or without a rail £3 3s.
        <br><br>Burial at Gulliford include Worthington Brice a merchant who’s business comprised of the whaling
        industry based at his home at Parsonage Stile, Margaret & Charles Baring who’s family were the banking dynasty
        from Courtlands, Brice Wakeford Lee of Ebford Barton a Major-General in the Indian Army, George Mason aged just
        25 a talented artist, his work hung in the Royal Academy.
        <br><br>By the end of the 19th century, the laws of dissenters had relaxed, new chapels were built in Exmouth &
        Topsham reducing the need to travel so far. The Methodists too had a new chapel, having for years hired the
        dis-used Dissenters chapel in Church Road, next to the Redwing (thence the former name The Vaults) and where
        Ellenthorpe now stands. The congregation was down to about ten with a minister who cancelled without notice, the
        roof was unsafe, repairs neglected and finally in 1907 the chapel was demolished.
        <br><br>Today the burial ground is jointly looked after by Lympstone & Woodbury Parish Councils. The perimeter
        walls and the Jervis, the Lees and the Stogdon tombs are Grade II Listed. A notice board informs visitors of
        it’s past, the site’s history hidden behind ivy & yew. A bench welcomes the caller to stop and listen to the
        bird song.

          George was born in Edinburgh in 1850 to Eliza &amp; Magnus, a
          merchant. <br>
          After school George entered a five year apprenticeship with a
          firm W &amp; R Chamber’s producing woodcuts. He also found
          time to attend the School of Art &amp; to contribute to the
          Sketching Club and in the summer of 1870 he spent his
          holiday making studies of the national collections. The
          following year saw George at the Edinburgh School of Art.
          1873 was a busy year, George’s painting titled “Bertha” was
          accepted for the Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition and
          George also travelled to France, Belgium &amp; Holland. His
          paintings are distinguished by fine colour &amp; great tenderness
          of handing and many of his paintings survived today.
          However on his return he was feeling unwell and in 1874 he
          travelled to Sark for health reasons. Feeling better, he
          travelled back to Scotland, then on to Paris before a spell in
          Croydon. But it was not long before he was ill again with his
          health finally broken, and it evident to all but himself that he
          had not long to live, he moved to Lympstone accompanied by
          his sister. Yet he still busied himself with his art, until this too
          was too much and he quietly locked away his paintings and
          etching materials. He died on the 27 th Feb 1876 of TB. aged
          25.

          <h3>Worthington Brice</h3>
          <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"
            data-src="images/DSCF1555.JPG"
            class="center-fit" style="float:right;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;width:auto;height:300px">
          This is the brick built tomb of Worthington Brice who lived in
          Parsonage Stile House, located on the shore of the Exe in the parish
          of Woodbury, just around the corner from Cliff Field in Lympstone.
          <br><br>
          Worthington was born in 1701 and the family seat was at
          Dinnington, Somerset between Ilminster, Yeovil &amp; Crewkerne. The
          name Worthington was carried by a number of male heirs, the name
          coming from a marriage of Hugh Brice &amp; Dorothy Worthington of
          Worthington Hall, Lancs. In national records one Worthington Brice
          was fined £300 during the Commonwealth for supporting the wrong
          side.
          <br><br>
          Our Worthington was brought up in Kenton, on the other side of the
          Exe, by parents Worthington &amp; Margaret. Worthington attended
          Wadham College in Oxford.
          <br><br>
          The next record we have of Worthington is a yearly contribution to
          Rev Hancock for Gulliford Chapel in 1733 of 14 shillings.
          <br><br>
          Worthington appears to have been a bit of a 18th century Richard
          Branson with Worthington’s name appearing on documents relating
          to mining rights, ship building, property and the whale trade.
          <br><br>
          In 1751 he built a ship called “Mary &amp; Sarah”, especially for whaling.
          He also had his Try-Works on the shore at Parsonage Stile where he
          boiled the whale blubber, until the posh folks of Burgmann’s Hill area
          complained of the smell and it was moved to Sowden End, south of
          Lympstone.
          <br><br>
          Worthington’s name is also on a record in 1752 as a trustee of
          Gulliford Chapel and on a document to increase the land and build a
          larger chapel on the site, along with Thomas Smith jr, a tallow
          chandler of Lympstone who would have made candles out of the
          whale fat.
          <br><br>
          Worthington continued to live at Parsonage Stile until his death aged
          80 &amp; is buried here with his wife Joan &amp; five of their children.

          I would like to talk about this chest tomb next [Editors Note: Photo will be uploaded soon], it’s the family
          vault to the Lee family.
          Sadly the memorial plaques are in a bad state of repair and I only know of 8 names of the
          deceased buried below, how many more we don’t know.
          <br><br>
          The first person buried here was not a Lee but a Robert Yeates, a trustee of Gulliford who died
          in 1779 aged 25 leaving a wife Jenny with sons aged 1 & 2.
          Jenny widowed at the age of 21 was the daughter of Matthew Lee.
          <br><br>
          We mentioned Thomas Lee of Sparkhays as giving the original plot of land for the building of Gulliford.
          Sparkhays was between Woodbury Village & Woodmanton but was lost much later in a fire.
          <br><br>
          The family inherited Ebford Barton in 1728 where they continued to live until 1891.
          The Lees obtained a coat of arms in 1759 which can be seen in the parish church at Woodbury.
          The family also lived in St Leonard’s, Exeter opposite Larkbeare House, home to the Baring family
          who started the Baring Bank. This is just passed St Leonard’s Church where the judges lived & now I
          believe the registry office is. The Lees having made money in farming moved into the woollen trade.
          <br><br>
          Jenny’s mother is buried here, she was the daughter of a rich London linen draper and had married Matthew Lee
          in 1742.
          Matthew had kept a diary of that time & in it recorded the cost of the marriage as an embroidered waistcoat
          £11, an Irish
          silk nightgown for himself £2, a brides diamond ring with 24 stones £16, a pair of 3 drop brilliant diamond
          earrings £105.
          In today’s money over £12,400 or in 1742 it could have bought 15 horses or paid for a skilled trades man to
          work for
          over 1,000 days. He also recorded the cost of drums & fiddles at 5s.
          <br><br>
          The other thing about the widowed Jenny was that having lost Robert, she went on to marry Nathaniel Wakeford,
          nothing unusual
          in itself until you know that Jenny’s older brother Matthew married Hannah Wakeford and Jenny’s younger
          brother Thomas Huckell
          married Mary Wakeford, all the Wakefords are from the Andover area, we know that Hannah was an only child of
          Joseph, a draper
          and that Mary was the daughter of Brice, also a draper, so maybe they are cousins. Nathaniel remains a
          mystery.
          <br><br>
          Thomas Huckell Lee is down as a trustee for Gulliford in 1777, living in St Leonards as a merchant.
          We know he was also the owner of a couple of ships registered in the Port of Exeter which covered the whole
          of the Exe. A letter of 1788 shows Thomas trying to sell one of the ships stating it was in the Greenland
          trade
          which was the cod trade. It’s not surprising he dabbled in this as his good friend Charles Baring who was now
          living at Courtlands on the boundary between Exmouth & Lympstone, had at least 16 ships over time. Charles &
          his
          wife are buried over there. Thomas & Mary had 12 children, the first 8 children were baptised at Topsham with
          the
          last 4 at Gulliford, was this when they moved from Exeter to Ebford? Thomas died in 1822.
          <br><br>
          The last 2 names on the plaques are to Thomas & Mary’s son Brice & their daughter Ann. Brice had decided on a
          life
          in the army. He didn’t marry. As Colonel he served in the Madras Native Infantry & also in the East Indies and
          by 1861
          he is a retired Major General living back at Ebford, who’s estate covered 106 acres and employed 8 labourers
          this does
          not include house servants. We are lucky to have a portrait of Brice seated on the right, along side his
          brother Major
          George Lee dressed in black and their nephew Col Sir James Jackson standing behind. Brice dies of a stroke in
          1871 leaving
          his unmarried sister Ann to continue living at Ebford keeping house as she had for her brother whilst he was
          away in the
          army. Ann dies in 1883 of heart disease, with Col Jackson present, as Gulliford is starting to decline in
          popularity.
          <br><br>
          This was the last of the Lee burials in this vault, however there was one last family link. Jenny and Robert’s
          son
          Matthew Lee Yeates, the little boy who lost his father when he was just 2. Matthew grow up and married, living
          at
          Primrose Cottage, Budleigh Salterton, a cottage we all know as it was to become the museum at Budleigh.
          Matthew had made his money setting up the Exmouth & General Devon Bank in Rolle Street. Sadly this went
          bankrupt in 1813. Sometime later we find Matthew in the records for Gulliford as a trustee, acting as a
          treasurer
          in 1845, he is now the Rev Matthew Lee Yeates of Cullumpton. He dies just 2 years later in Tiverton, deciding
          not to
          be buried at Gulliford.

          <h3>George Lee</h3>
          <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"
            data-src="images/George Lee Headstone.JPG"
            class="center-fit" style="float:right;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;width:auto;height:300px">
          This beautiful headstone is also one of the saddest, a memorial to George Lee,
          who was the 9th child of Thomas Huckell Lee & his wife Mary.
          <br><br>
          George was born July 1787, baptised at Gulliford in August and died the following month in September the same
          year,
          and sadly this is all we know of baby George. We can hope that because there is space left for any other
          children that didn’t survive infancy that this was the last of Thomas & Mary’s 12 children to die young.
          <br><br>
        </div>

        <div style="height:auto;overflow:auto">
          <h3>Sarah & Eliza Russell</h3>
          Next to George is Sarah & Eliza Russell, they were aunt & niece, both unmarried,
          both working at Ebford Barton for the Lee family, but George & Sarah and Eliza never met in life.
          <br><br>
          Sarah was born in Clyst St George and Eliza the daughter of a farm labourer John who rose to
          become a blacksmith, was born in Woodbury.
          <br><br>
          Sarah & Eliza worked in the Lee household as servants, under Brice Wakeford Lee.
          In 1851 there was also a James Russell working as a house servant born in Farrington,
          duties would have been footman, valet etc we don’t know if he was related but 10 years
          later Mary Russell has joined the household as cook and 12 year old Adam Russell as
          Boy of all Work. James Russell is visiting the Lees as Professor of Music at Oxford and
          John Russell and family are farming nearby at Lower Ebford. So it looks like both families
          looked out for each other.
          <br><br>
          We have no record of what Sarah and Eliza looked like but they would have attended chapel
          here at Gulliford each Sunday with their employer walking through the gateway just as you
          have today. We know from the headstone that Sarah worked for the Lees for 47 years and
          Eliza 37 years. Sarah was 69 when she died in 1870 of asthma & a diseased heart whilst Eliza
          was 47 when she caught T.B and died the same year as Sarah. Employer Brice Lee died the following month.
          <br><br>
          I’m sure that the Lee family would have paid for the headstone for Sarah & Eliza, the wording
          they chose such as much esteemed, especially respected, speaks volumes about these 2 women and their
          relation with the Lees which went further than just employer & employee, burying Sarah & Eliza next to a
          family member.

      <h2>Gulliford Burial Ground wall Repairs and heritage Lottery Application</h2>

      Work is now underway at the Dissenters’ burial ground to repair the wall which fell down at
      the end of last year. The two councils, the joint Gulliford Burial Ground committee and the
      Friends of Gulliford Burial ground are working together to do its best to accomplish all the
      works needed to preserve this lovely site into the future. One of the ways we are doing this
      is to create a working group to apply to the Heritage Lottery Fund for a grant to preserve
      this important local history site and to raise awareness that it exists.

      <br> <br>
      We’ve been working hard already and have created a questionnaire which will soon land
      through your doors which will give us more information about how many people know
      where it is, have visited it and about general views on how important you feel local history
      is. Please look out for this questionnaire and we’d be very grateful if you could fill it in and
      drop it into the Clerk’s office or to Londis where there is a box for replies. Alternatively, we
      have produced an interactive google form which is easy to use can be accessed via the
      link below:
