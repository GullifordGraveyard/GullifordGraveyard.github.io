Johann, having changed his name to John taught the value of good business man ship to his eldest sons John and Francis, but sadly Charles&#39;s father died when Charles was only six years old. Nothing much is known about Charles&#39;s younger life, however he marries in September 1767 to Margaret Gould at the Gould estate at Lew Trenchard. Margaret was born around 1743, possibility just a year younger than Charles. Margaret was the daughter of William Drake Gould. Charles and Margaret settle at Courtlands, Withycombe, on the Lympstone boundary. A house set in grounds sweeping down to the bank of the River Exe, with a Ladies Walk a mile long, giving views to the hills beyond. Charles develops the house into an elegant mansion, in line with his social standing. The couple start attending Gulliford Chapel, a non-conformist meeting house, north of Lympstone travelling by carriage, the Baring donating a barrel organ for the chapel. Charles and Margaret have nine children, whilst Charles endeavours to support the family working as a merchant. It is at this stage that things start to go wrong, whether through bad judgement or bad luck, the mistakes pile up. Charles goes into business with a fulling mill at Exwick, this folds, partnership in the Devonshire Bank which goes into bankruptcy, the list goes on and on. His brothers John and Francis &quot;regularly rescued Charles from ruin and thus preserve the family good name being scandalized by Charles&#39;s almost monstrous management&quot;. John and Francis go into business together creating Baring Brothers &amp; Co of London, without Charles. But Charles&#39;s spending on Courtland and bad financial deals, are greatly out striping his resources. Devon Gardens Trust, 2013 reads &quot;Charles jr to his uncle, Sir Francis, in 1807 requested the family be allowed to stay on. His mother was … very desirous to be able to retain this place ….. if we could by any means do so.&quot; It wasn&#39;t to be. In an age prior to the census, we not know the address of where the family took refuge. Margaret dies in Oct 1812, with Charles dying aged 87 in 1829. I ordered Charles&#39;s will of April that year, expecting to be charged for the service, but the will was so short, no fee was demanded. Charles address was not forth coming just stating that daughter Emily, was left to sort the probate out. Margaret and Charles are buried at Gulliford. A plaque records their names, newly restored with Heritage Lottery Funding, the plaque has been mounted on the boundary wall near to where we believe their vault is. Charles and Margaret&#39;s son William in order to inherit the Lew Trenchard estate has to change his name to Baring-Gould, William marries Diana Sabine and it is through her that &quot;Who Do You Think You Are ?&quot; follows the royal line through. Charles&#39;s great grandson is Rev Sabine Baring-Gould and Charles&#39;s 5 x great grandson is the comedian Josh Widdicombe &amp; 6 x great uncle to Princess Diana. </div><div style="height:auto;overflow:auto;" class="my-3" data-v-2d810670><h3 data-v-2d810670>William Clarke &amp; Elizabeth Clarke <small data-v-2d810670>(25)</small></h3> &quot;Here lyth the body William son of William Clarke and grandchildren of Richard Clarke also of Elizabeth relict of the above, the child and daughter Thomas Smith esq of City of Exeter who died 22nd Dec 1782 aged 61&quot;.

Thomas appears to have died without issue mentioned in his will. This family lived prior to modern documents ie death certificates &amp; census, so piecing their story together may come with mistakes. Thomas Clarke born 1708 in Topsham &amp; William Clarke born 1710 also in Topsham both had parents Richard &amp; Anne. In 1737 Thomas Clarke of Woodbury is mentioned as a husbandman, thence he would have had the land at Gulliford which is in Woodbury. Thomas was a pupil of Dr Doddridge in 1773 in Lympstone plus an assistant to Rev Jervis. Thomas married Grace Hancock, daughter of Rev Eliezer Hancock minister of Gulliford for 28 years. He married his second wife Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith sen (also buried at Gulliford) in 1767. In Thomas&#39;s will, written in 1759, it still mentions wife, Grace Clarke and also brother, Richard. Thomas died in 1778. In Elizabeth&#39;s will read in 1783, she leaves £20 to Rev Jervis and leaves instructions to be buried with her husband at Gulliford. </div><div style="height:auto;overflow:auto;" class="my-3" data-v-2d810670><h3 data-v-2d810670>Sarah Robinson <small data-v-2d810670>(26)</small></h3> &quot;Beneath this stone deposit of the mortal remains of Sarah Robinson the only daughter of Isaac Robinson of London.

Thomas sen died Jan 13th 1826, leaving a will in which property in Lympstone &amp; Topsham are left to his wife, after which if Dorothy dies the estate is left to son Thomas, who had to pay three hundred pounds plus additional property to his two sisters. In the 1841 census Dorothy is living with Anna, plus Sarah Walrond (aged 65 maybe a sister?) also Emily Bolt aged circa 15 (servant?). Unmarried Emlin had earlier died in Sept 1832.
