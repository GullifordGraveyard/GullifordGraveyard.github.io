     <h3>George Manson</h3>\r\n        <img :src=\"headshotUrl\" class=\"center-fit\">\r\n        George was born in Edinburgh in 1850 to Eliza &amp; Magnus, a\r\n        merchant. <br>\r\n        After school George entered a five year apprenticeship with a\r\n        firm W &amp; R Chamber's producing woodcuts. He also found\r\n        time to attend the School of Art &amp; to contribute to the\r\n        Sketching Club and in the summer of 1870 he spent his\r\n        holiday making studies of the national collections. The\r\n        following year saw George at the Edinburgh School of Art.\r\n        1873 was a busy year, George's painting titled \"Bertha\" was\r\n        accepted for the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition and\r\n        George also travelled to France, Belgium &amp; Holland. His\r\n        paintings are distinguished by fine colour &amp; great tenderness\r\n        of handing and many of his paintings survived today.\r\n        However on his return he was feeling unwell and in 1874 he\r\n        travelled to Sark for health reasons. Feeling better, he\r\n        travelled back to Scotland, then on to Paris before a spell in\r\n        Croydon. But it was not long before he was ill again with his\r\n        health finally broken, and it evident to all but himself that he\r\n        had not long to live, he moved to Lympstone accompanied by\r\n        his sister. Yet he still busied himself with his art, until this too\r\n        was too much and he quietly locked away his paintings and\r\n        etching materials. He died on the 27 th Feb 1876 of TB. aged\r\n        25.\r\n\r\n        <br><br><br>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n    img {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        float: right;\r\n        margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;\r\n        width: auto;\r\n        max-height: 300px\r\n    }\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        computed: {\r\n            headshotUrl() {\r\n                return require(\"@/assets/images/george_manson.jpg\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>","import { render } from \"./GeorgeManson.vue?vue&type=template&id=df984a36&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./GeorgeManson.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./GeorgeManson.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./GeorgeManson.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=df984a36&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-df984a36\"\n\nexport default script","<template>\r\n    <div style=\"height:auto;overflow:auto\">\r\n        <h3>Worthington Brice</h3>\r\n        <img :src=\"tombUrl\" class=\"center-fit\">\r\n        This is the brick built tomb of Worthington Brice who lived in\r\n        Parsonage Stile House, located on the shore of the Exe in the parish\r\n        of Woodbury, just around the corner from Cliff Field in Lympstone.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Worthington was born in 1701 and the family seat was at\r\n        Dinnington, Somerset between Ilminster, Yeovil &amp; Crewkerne. The\r\n        name Worthington was carried by a number of male heirs, the name\r\n        coming from a marriage of Hugh Brice &amp; Dorothy Worthington of\r\n        Worthington Hall, Lancs. In national records one Worthington Brice\r\n        was fined \t&#163;300 during the Commonwealth for supporting the wrong\r\n        side.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Our Worthington was brought up in Kenton, on the other side of the\r\n        Exe, by parents Worthington &amp; Margaret. Worthington attended\r\n        Wadham College in Oxford.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The next record we have of Worthington is a yearly contribution to\r\n        Rev Hancock for Gulliford Chapel in 1733 of 14 shillings.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Worthington appears to have been a bit of a 18th century Richard\r\n        Branson with Worthington's name appearing on documents relating\r\n        to mining rights, ship building, property and the whale trade.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        In 1751 he built a ship called \"Mary &amp; Sarah\", especially for whaling.\r\n        He also had his Try-Works on the shore at Parsonage Stile where he\r\n        boiled the whale blubber, until the posh folks of Burgmann's Hill area\r\n        complained of the smell and it was moved to Sowden End, south of\r\n        Lympstone.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Worthington's name is also on a record in 1752 as a trustee of\r\n        Gulliford Chapel and on a document to increase the land and build a\r\n        larger chapel on the site, along with Thomas Smith jr, a tallow\r\n        chandler of Lympstone who would have made candles out of the\r\n        whale fat.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Worthington continued to live at Parsonage Stile until his death aged\r\n        80 &amp; is buried here with his wife Joan &amp; five of their children.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n    img {\r\n        float: right;\r\n        margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;\r\n        width: auto;\r\n        max-height: 300px\r\n    }\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        computed: {\r\n            tombUrl() {\r\n                return require(\"@/assets/images/worthington_bryce_tomb.jpg\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>","import { render } from \"./WorthingtonBryce.vue?vue&type=template&id=5582f70a&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./WorthingtonBryce.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./WorthingtonBryce.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./WorthingtonBryce.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5582f70a&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-5582f70a\"\n\nexport default script","<template>\r\n    <div style=\"height:auto;overflow:auto\">\r\n        <h3>Lee Family</h3>\r\n        <img :src=\"briceUrl\" class=\"center-fit\">\r\n        <img :src=\"houseUrl\" class=\"center-fit\">\r\n        I would like to talk about this chest tomb next [Editors Note: Photo was not submitted alongside article], it's\r\n        the family\r\n        vault to the Lee family.\r\n        Sadly the memorial plaques are in a bad state of repair and I only know of 8 names of the\r\n        deceased buried below, how many more we don't know.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The first person buried here was not a Lee but a Robert Yeates, a trustee of Gulliford who died\r\n        in 1779 aged 25 leaving a wife Jenny with sons aged 1 & 2.\r\n        Jenny widowed at the age of 21 was the daughter of Matthew Lee.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        We mentioned Thomas Lee of Sparkhays as giving the original plot of land for the building of\r\n        Gulliford.\r\n        Sparkhays was between Woodbury Village & Woodmanton but was lost much later in a fire.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The family inherited Ebford Barton in 1728 where they continued to live until 1891.\r\n        The Lees obtained a coat of arms in 1759 which can be seen in the parish church at Woodbury.\r\n        The family also lived in St Leonard's, Exeter opposite Larkbeare House, home to the Baring family\r\n        who started the Baring Bank. This is just passed St Leonard's Church where the judges lived & now I\r\n        believe the registry office is. The Lees having made money in farming moved into the woollen trade.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Jenny's mother is buried here, she was the daughter of a rich London linen draper and had married\r\n        Matthew Lee\r\n        in 1742.\r\n        Matthew had kept a diary of that time & in it recorded the cost of the marriage as an embroidered\r\n        waistcoat\r\n        &#163;11, an Irish\r\n        silk nightgown for himself &#163;2, a brides diamond ring with 24 stones &#163;16, a pair of 3 drop brilliant\r\n        diamond\r\n        earrings &#163;105.\r\n        In today's money over &#163;12,400 or in 1742 it could have bought 15 horses or paid for a skilled trades\r\n        man to\r\n        work for\r\n        over 1,000 days. He also recorded the cost of drums & fiddles at 5s.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The other thing about the widowed Jenny was that having lost Robert, she went on to marry Nathaniel\r\n        Wakeford,\r\n        nothing unusual\r\n        in itself until you know that Jenny's older brother Matthew married Hannah Wakeford and Jenny's\r\n        younger\r\n        brother Thomas Huckell\r\n        married Mary Wakeford, all the Wakefords are from the Andover area, we know that Hannah was an only\r\n        child of\r\n        Joseph, a draper\r\n        and that Mary was the daughter of Brice, also a draper, so maybe they are cousins. Nathaniel remains\r\n        a\r\n        mystery.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        Thomas Huckell Lee is down as a trustee for Gulliford in 1777, living in St Leonards as a merchant.\r\n        We know he was also the owner of a couple of ships registered in the Port of Exeter which covered\r\n        the whole\r\n        of the Exe. A letter of 1788 shows Thomas trying to sell one of the ships stating it was in the\r\n        Greenland\r\n        trade\r\n        which was the cod trade. It's not surprising he dabbled in this as his good friend Charles Baring\r\n        who was now\r\n        living at Courtlands on the boundary between Exmouth & Lympstone, had at least 16 ships over time.\r\n        Charles &\r\n        his\r\n        wife are buried over there. Thomas & Mary had 12 children, the first 8 children were baptised at\r\n        Topsham with\r\n        the\r\n        last 4 at Gulliford, was this when they moved from Exeter to Ebford? Thomas died in 1822.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        The last 2 names on the plaques are to Thomas & Mary's son Brice & their daughter Ann. Brice had\r\n        decided on a\r\n        life\r\n        in the army. He didn't marry. As Colonel he served in the Madras Native Infantry & also in the East\r\n        Indies and\r\n        by 1861\r\n        he is a retired Major General living back at Ebford, who's estate covered 106 acres and employed 8\r\n        labourers\r\n        this does\r\n        not include house servants. We are lucky to have a portrait of Brice seated on the right, along side\r\n        his\r\n        brother Major\r\n        George Lee dressed in black and their nephew Col Sir James Jackson standing behind. Brice dies of a\r\n        stroke in\r\n        1871 leaving\r\n        his unmarried sister Ann to continue living at Ebford keeping house as she had for her brother\r\n        whilst he was\r\n        away in the\r\n        army. Ann dies in 1883 of heart disease, with Col Jackson present, as Gulliford is starting to\r\n        decline in\r\n        popularity.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        This was the last of the Lee burials in this vault, however there was one last family link. Jenny\r\n        and Robert's\r\n        son\r\n        Matthew Lee Yeates, the little boy who lost his father when he was just 2. Matthew grow up and\r\n        married, living\r\n        at\r\n        Primrose Cottage, Budleigh Salterton, a cottage we all know as it was to become the museum at\r\n        Budleigh.\r\n        Matthew had made his money setting up the Exmouth & General Devon Bank in Rolle Street. Sadly this\r\n        went\r\n        bankrupt in 1813. Sometime later we find Matthew in the records for Gulliford as a trustee, acting\r\n        as a\r\n        treasurer\r\n        in 1845, he is now the Rev Matthew Lee Yeates of Cullumpton. He dies just 2 years later in Tiverton,\r\n        deciding\r\n        not to\r\n        be buried at Gulliford.\r\n\r\n        <br><br>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n    img {\r\n        float: right;\r\n        margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;\r\n        width: auto;\r\n        max-height: 300px\r\n    }\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        computed: {\r\n            briceUrl() {\r\n                return require(\"@/assets/images/Brice_Wakeford_Lee.jpg\");\r\n            },\r\n            houseUrl() {\r\n                return require(\"@/assets/images/Ebford_Barton.jpg\");\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>","import { render } from \"./LeeFamily.vue?vue&type=template&id=5ceb94c8&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./LeeFamily.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./LeeFamily.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./LeeFamily.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=5ceb94c8&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-5ceb94c8\"\n\nexport default script","<template>\r\n    <div style=\"height:auto;overflow:auto\">\r\n        <h3>George Lee</h3>\r\n        <img :src=\"headstoneUrl\" class=\"center-fit\">\r\n        This beautiful headstone is also one of the saddest, a memorial to George Lee,\r\n        who was the 9th child of Thomas Huckell Lee & his wife Mary.\r\n        <br><br>\r\n        George was born July 1787, baptised at Gulliford in August and died the following month in September\r\n        the same\r\n        year,\r\n        and sadly this is all we know of baby George.

James Russell is visiting the Lees as Professor of Music at Oxford and\r\n        John Russell and family are farming nearby at Lower Ebford.

We know from the headstone that Sarah worked for the Lees for 47 years and\r\n        Eliza 37 years. Sarah was 69 when she died in 1870 of asthma & a diseased heart whilst Eliza\r\n        was 47 when she caught T.B and died the same year as Sarah.
