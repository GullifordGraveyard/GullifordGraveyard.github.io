John was from Kelsale, Suffolk, roughly nine years older than Margaret, John worked as a farm labourer and as a bailiff on the Drake estate whilst living in Woodbury parish. They had children Sarah in 1826 & Thomas in 1830. John died in Dec 24th 1857 aged 71, in Lympstone. Margaret in 1861 is supporting herself as a dressmaker, with Sarah and a grand-daughter Elizabeth.

Johann, having changed his name to John taught the value of good business man ship to his eldest sons John and Francis, but sadly Charles's father died when Charles was only six years old. Nothing much is known about Charles's younger life, however he marries in September 1767 to Margaret Gould at the Gould estate at Lew Trenchard. Margaret was born around 1743, possibility just a year younger than Charles. Margaret was the daughter of William Drake Gould. Charles and Margaret settle at Courtlands, Withycombe, on the Lympstone boundary. A house set in grounds sweeping down to the bank of the River Exe, with a Ladies Walk a mile long, giving views to the hills beyond. Charles develops the house into an elegant mansion, in line with his social standing.  The couple start attending Gulliford Chapel, a non-conformist meeting house, north of Lympstone travelling by carriage, the Baring donating a barrel organ for the chapel. Charles and Margaret have nine children, whilst Charles endeavours to support the family working as a merchant. It is at this stage that things start to go wrong, whether through bad judgement or bad luck, the mistakes pile up. Charles goes into business with a fulling mill at Exwick, this folds, partnership in the Devonshire Bank which goes into bankruptcy, the list goes on and on. His brothers John and Francis \"regularly rescued Charles from ruin and thus preserve the family good name being scandalized by Charles's almost monstrous management\". John and Francis go into business together creating Baring Brothers & Co of London, without Charles. But Charles's spending on Courtland and bad financial deals, are greatly out striping his resources. Devon Gardens Trust, 2013 reads \"Charles jr to his uncle, Sir Francis, in 1807 requested the family be allowed to stay on. His mother was &hellip; very desirous to be able to retain this place &hellip;.. if we could by any means do so.\" It wasn't to be. In an age prior to the census, we not know the address of where the family took refuge. Margaret dies in Oct 1812, with Charles dying aged 87 in 1829. I ordered Charles's will of April that year, expecting to be charged for the service, but the will was so short, no fee was demanded. Charles address was not forth coming just stating that daughter Emily, was left to sort the probate out. Margaret and Charles are buried at Gulliford. A plaque records their names, newly restored with Heritage Lottery Funding, the plaque has been mounted on the boundary wall near to where we believe their vault is. Charles and Margaret's son William in order to inherit the Lew Trenchard estate has to change his name to Baring-Gould, William marries Diana Sabine and it is through her that \"Who Do You Think You Are ?\" follows the royal line through. Charles's great grandson is Rev Sabine Baring-Gould and Charles's 5 x great grandson is the comedian Josh Widdicombe & 6 x great uncle to Princess Diana.\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div style=\"height:auto;overflow:auto\" class=\"my-3\">\r\n                <h3>William Clarke & Elizabeth Clarke <small>(25)</small></h3>\r\n                \"Here lyth the body William son of William Clarke and grandchildren of Richard Clarke also of Elizabeth relict of the above, the child and daughter Thomas Smith esq of City of Exeter who died 22nd Dec 1782 aged 61\". The inscription is missing sections. This tomb lies in front of the 2nd chapel, built on land given by Rev (?) Thomas Clarke in 1777 on a 300 year lease. Thomas appears to have died without issue mentioned in his will. This family lived prior to modern documents ie death certificates & census, so piecing their story together may come with mistakes. Thomas Clarke born 1708 in Topsham & William Clarke born 1710 also in Topsham both had parents Richard & Anne. In 1737 Thomas Clarke of Woodbury is mentioned as a husbandman, thence he would have had the land at Gulliford which is in Woodbury. Thomas was a pupil of Dr Doddridge in 1773 in Lympstone plus an assistant to Rev Jervis. Thomas married Grace Hancock, daughter of Rev Eliezer Hancock minister of Gulliford for 28 years. He married his second wife Elizabeth Smith, daughter of Thomas Smith sen (also buried at Gulliford) in 1767. In Thomas's will, written in 1759, it still mentions wife, Grace Clarke and also brother, Richard. Thomas died in 1778. In Elizabeth's will read in 1783, she leaves &pound;20 to Rev Jervis and leaves instructions to be buried with her husband at Gulliford.\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div style=\"height:auto;overflow:auto\" class=\"my-3\">\r\n                <h3>Sarah Robinson <small>(26)</small></h3>\r\n                \"Beneath this stone deposit of the mortal remains of Sarah Robinson the only daughter of Isaac Robinson of London.

Earlier in Trewman's Exeter Flying Post Feb 21st 1856 \"Feb 13 at Woodbury by Rev Lovebond Fulford assisted by the Rev George Porter rector of Lympstone Capt Smith RN to Eliza fourth daughter of the late Thomas Stodgon & niece of the late Capt Sexpitch\". Thomas a captain in the Royal Navy of Lympstone died Mar 8th 1863 of senile gangrene which he had suffered for 2 months. In his will his effects are under &pound;4,000. The plaque may well have been originally placed on the side of the demolished chapel and then spent most of the 20th century laid on top of Sarah Robinson's tomb, next to his parents. The plaque decorated with a stone family crest by Faulkner, Exeter, had space for other family members but this was not taken up. The plaque has now been mounted on the boundary wall at the back on the left, safe from frost in an upright position.\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div style=\"height:auto;overflow:auto\" class=\"my-3\">\r\n                <h3>Thomas Smith, Dorothy Smith, Emlin Smith, Anna Smith & Thomas Smith <small>(28)</small></h3>\r\n                Father Thomas, a gentleman married Dorothy Walrond on 16th Feb 1797 in Lympstone, they lived in what is now called Queen Anne House (next to the railway) in The Strand. They had 3 children Emlin in 1798, Thomas 1800 & Anna 1801. We know that Emlin & Anna were baptised at Gulliford. Thomas sen died Jan 13th 1826, leaving a will in which property in Lympstone & Topsham are left to his wife, after which if Dorothy dies the estate is left to son Thomas, who had to pay three hundred pounds plus additional property to his two sisters. In the 1841 census Dorothy is living with Anna, plus Sarah Walrond (aged 65 maybe a sister?) also Emily Bolt aged circa 15 (servant?). Unmarried Emlin had earlier died in Sept 1832. Then Dorothy also died in 1844 aged 81. The 1851 census show Anna now living with the Newbury family, a family of bootmakers and not in the same social class as the family originated from however Anna is listed as insane, lodging at the same address is Miss Sarah Walrond aged 77, born Lympstone. Anna dies in 1857 aged 55 and finally Thomas jr died in 1863, aged 63.

Mellony was one of at least 7 children. On the 1841 census Mellony is down as Malone, living with her mother Anna and Sister Anna in Dawlish. By 1851, Mellony is lodging in Westbury on Trym, Glouc. without family members, as an independent gentlewoman. Then in 1861, Mellony is back in Exeter, living at no. 45 Magdalen Street again as a lodger. The next entrance on the 1861 census after Mellony's is for a Kate Chapple, whether this people is related is unknown. Mellony died 4th April 1866 in Magdalen Street and although the Exeter Dissenters Graveyard is very nearby, by this time the graveyard was full. Mellony left a very full will with lots of detail, plus a codicil, leaving property and items, with the estate under &pound;5,000.

On the 1861 census, Ellen is recorded as a draper's assistant, living with her parents in Fore Street, Topsham plus older Sister Thirza (tallow chandler) and Brother Frederick (a mariner). The headstone may have been added later as it states, Ellen Hodder daughter of Samuel & Matilda Hodder, who followed her sister Thirza to the grave, April 16th 1862, aged 20 years & 5 months. A death report in the newspaper states that Ellen was at Woodland Farm, Woodbury at the time of her death and the third daughter. Thirza Matilda Hodder, daughter of Samuel & Matilda was baptised at Topsham in 1831 and on the 1871 census, aged 39, earning a living as a music teacher in Topsham.

Robert was a shipping merchant and consul for the government, mentioned in archives kept in record offices today, ie Kew records or Bedfordshire & Luton with correspondence between Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, ambassador at Madrid & Robert.

Robert who was the son of Robert & Isobell Wilkie was born in Scoonie, Fife, Scotland circa 1819 and married Katherine Penelope ? An archive from Kew states that Robert was due a salary in 1868, whether this is when he returned to England is unclear. Katherine was living in Lympstone prior to her death in Feb 5th 1791 and Robert aged 72, died shortly after in Dec 3rd 1791.

Yet he still busied himself with his art, until this too\r\n            was too much and he quietly locked away his paintings and\r\n            etching materials.

Charles came from a well to do family, his younger brother was to become Lord Gifford, Master of the Rolls. Charles worked in the family grocery business with his father & brother in the High street, Exeter. In 1819 Charles married Mary Moresby and they settled down & had 6 children. 4 of their children were baptised at Gulliford between 1823 & 1837 and in this 14 year period these were the only baptisms conducted at Gulliford. John Bird, who studied Gulliford in 1979, wrote that this implied a great drop in the numbers of young adults attending the meeting house & that maybe down to the high prices charged by Gulliford for the baptism service.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Charles & Mary lived in Exmouth at Cliff End House, which many of you will know today as The Park Hotel along Exeter Road. It was called Cliff End House because prior to the land reclaiming, the house was on the shore line, over- looking the sea. It was converted into a pub in the early 20th century.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Charles's name is on the Tithe Map of 1839 in Lympstone as owning property, so the family appears to be very comfortably off, Charles & Mary's son Charles jr after studying law moved to Canada & became a MP there.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        In the 1851 census, our Charles is recorded as the Deputy Lieut of Devon, still married to Mary, children all left home, however there are 5 servants to look after just the 2 of them.        The fourth plaque of the pedestal plinth is missing, this memorial suffered largely during the 20th century to vandalism, whether this was to Ann or Joseph we will never find out. Ann died in 1859 at Cliff House, home to the Gifford family to whom they were great friends.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Charles died in 1855, aged 75 years old and the Rev of the time recorded that Charles was an irregular attendant at Gulliford, which seems a bit unfair as Charles served for many years as a trustee for Gulliford. Alongside Charles is buried his sister Harriet. Harriet had continued to live at Parker's Well House and remained unmarried, died 9 years after Charles, leaving &pound;50,000 in her will in 1864, a huge amount of money then. Harriet would have been buried at Gulliford because the graveyard of the Exeter Dissenters had closed. They are interred near the Baring's vault, which would originally had railings around the base. Parker's Well House was roughly located behind the now County Hall, along the Topsham Road, the house having been completely destroyed by a WWII high explosive bomb.

Nathaniel remains\r\n            a\r\n            mystery.\r\n            <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n            Thomas Huckell Lee is down as a trustee for Gulliford in 1777, living in St Leonards as a merchant.\r\n            We know he was also the owner of a couple of ships registered in the Port of Exeter which covered\r\n            the whole\r\n            of the Exe. A letter of 1788 shows Thomas trying to sell one of the ships stating it was in the\r\n            Greenland\r\n            trade\r\n            which was the cod trade. It's not surprising he dabbled in this as his good friend Charles Baring\r\n            who was now\r\n            living at Courtlands on the boundary between Exmouth & Lympstone, had at least 16 ships over time.\r\n            Charles &\r\n            his\r\n            wife are buried over there. Thomas & Mary had 12 children, the first 8 children were baptised at\r\n            Topsham with\r\n            the\r\n            last 4 at Gulliford, was this when they moved from Exeter to Ebford? Thomas died in 1822.\r\n            <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n            The last 2 names on the plaques are to Thomas & Mary's son Brice & their daughter Ann. Brice had\r\n            decided on a\r\n            life\r\n            in the army. He didn't marry. As Colonel he served in the Madras Native Infantry & also in the East\r\n            Indies and\r\n            by 1861\r\n            he is a retired Major General living back at Ebford, who's estate covered 106 acres and employed 8\r\n            labourers\r\n            this does\r\n            not include house servants. We are lucky to have a portrait of Brice seated on the right, along side\r\n            his\r\n            brother Major\r\n            George Lee dressed in black and their nephew Col Sir James Jackson standing behind. Brice dies of a\r\n            stroke in\r\n            1871 leaving\r\n            his unmarried sister Ann to continue living at Ebford keeping house as she had for her brother\r\n            whilst he was\r\n            away in the\r\n            army. Ann dies in 1883 of heart disease, with Col Jackson present, as Gulliford is starting to\r\n            decline in\r\n            popularity.\r\n            <br>\r\n            <br>\r\n            This was the last of the Lee burials in this vault, however there was one last family link.

Matthew grow up and\r\n            married, living\r\n            at\r\n            Primrose Cottage, Budleigh Salterton, a cottage we all know as it was to become the museum at\r\n            Budleigh.\r\n            Matthew had made his money setting up the Exmouth & General Devon Bank in Rolle Street. Sadly this\r\n            went\r\n            bankrupt in 1813. Sometime later we find Matthew in the records for Gulliford as a trustee, acting\r\n            as a\r\n            treasurer\r\n            in 1845, he is now the Rev Matthew Lee Yeates of Cullumpton.

They had 2 sons Matthew Lee Yeates christened at Topsham in 1777 and Robert christened at Gulliford in Dec 1778. Robert sen was on the board of trustees at Gulliford in May 1777. However Robert died 5th Aug 1779, aged 25 years.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Matthew Lee born 1744, son of Matthew & Jenny Lee. Matthew jr married Hannah Wakeford in Andover in 1767, there may have been a son born & died in 1768, also daughters Hannah & Jane Mary. As Matthew died 1788 and his father Matthew died in 1774, some records are hard to tell apart. Matthew Lee esq of Woodbury was on the board of trustees at Gulliford in 1777, plus a Mr M Lee paid 2s per year at Gulliford for seating for his servants in 1788.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Hannah Lee wife of Matthew Lee of Mount Ebford, was christened in 1746 in Andover to parents Joseph & Hannah (nee Twogood). Hannah was brought up by step mother Mary (nee Steele) and lived with step brother William Steele Wakeford. Hannah was married in East Street Independent Chapel, Andover the same chapel where she had been christened. Hannah died April 22 1818.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Jane (Jenny) was a daughter of a rich London draper and married Matthew Lee on his return from learning his father's woollen trade in Holland. The couple continued to live in London, renting Ebford Barton out. Matthew kept a marriage expenditure which included some of the following : embroidered waistcoat & buttons &pound;11.6s, 8 ruffled shirts &pound;1.8s, Irish silk nightgown &pound;2.2s, jewellery for the bride of a diamond ring with 24 stones &pound;16, a pair of 3 drop brilliant diamond earrings &pound;105 & drums & fiddles 5s. The groom's family also paid &pound;5,000 & Jane's family &pound;3,000 toward the marriage. Jane & Matthew return to Ebford Barton once the lease was up for the tenants, upon which money was spent doing up the house & garden including planting nectarines. The couple's children were Matthew (jr) born 1744, Jenny born 1745 - died 1749, Thomas Huckell Lee born 1752 & Jenny born 1757.  Matthew had stayed in touch with the baring family & with John Baring they invested in Benjamin Donn's first detailed map of Devon of which Gulliford was also added. The lee family & the Baring continued their support for Gulliford, however Matthew died the same year as the new second chapel was built at Gulliford in 1774, aged 59. Jane died in 1800 aged 85, out of Matthew & Jane only Jane's name survives on the tomb. Jane Lee had left in her will &pound;100 for the benefit of the minister in 1800. This money was used to buy &pound;163 18s 8d worth of capital stock at 3 per cent, the names of the investors were Thomas H.

In 1792 Thomas is a Gulliford Trustee & there is also a plaque to the Woodbury Volunteers of which Thomas is the captain in the parish church in Woodbury dated 1799. Thomas died 1st June 1822 aged 70.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Brice Wakeford Lee was the son of Thomas & Mary. He joined the army and as Colonel served in the Madras Native Infantry & East Indies. In the census of 1851 Brice is recorded as owning 106 acres, employing 8 labourers (not including servants. Brice rose to the rank of Major General and had retired by the 1861 census to Ebford. He died at Ebford 11st Jan 1871 aged 87, leaving his will to Sister Ann.\r\n            <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n            Ann Grier Lee daughter of Thomas & Mary was born at Mount Ebford 30th Nov 1796 and christened at Gulliford 17th Dec the same year. Ann never married staying at Ebford where the 1841 census finds her with her brother Brice along with employees the Hayman & Russell families.

Sarah was the daughter of John Russell a farm labourer and born in Clyst St George. Eliza also daughter of a John Russell, a blacksmith was born in Woodbury. In 1846, Sarah was awarded &pound;1 10s in an agriculture show for working for her employer for 22 years, in the same show John Russell got &pound;2 for 38 years servitude with Mr Col. Lee.

In a will of John Bending a deceased tallow chandler he left his grandson Samuel Hodder his business and property in Topsham. Samuel married Hannah Bending at Topsham in 1807. Two years later their son Samuel was born, who continued the trade in Fore Street, Topsham and married Matilda Charlotte Hore in St Sidwell's church, Exeter in 1831. This story is of their children. By 1851 census, the shop as well as selling candles was trading in groceries and earthenware. The family may have used the burial ground at Gulliford due to the lack of space for dissenters at Topsham. Samuel and Matilda both died aged 67, both buried at Gulliford.\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>","import { render } from \"./HodderChildren.vue?vue&type=template&id=84b32ce4\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\munkf\\\\Documents\\\\repositories\\\\GraveyardWebsiteInVue\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader-v16\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","import { render } from \"./HistoriesOfBuried.vue?vue&type=template&id=2d810670&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./HistoriesOfBuried.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./HistoriesOfBuried.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./HistoriesOfBuried.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=2d810670&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\munkf\\\\Documents\\\\repositories\\\\GraveyardWebsiteInVue\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader-v16\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render],['__scopeId',\"data-v-2d810670\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
