The first chapel was built in\r\n                1689,\r\n                the band of dissenters grow made up by the new middle classes to humbler locals from Lympstone,\r\n                Woodbury,\r\n                Ebford, Exmouth & the surrounding areas, often with a dozen carriages parked outside, not an easy\r\n                journey on\r\n                unmade roads. <br><br>A violent riot broke out at one time, entering the chapel and smashing windows\r\n                reminding\r\n                the congregation of the risk of worshipping outside the established church. In 1774 a further plot of\r\n                land was\r\n                donated to extend the site for a second larger chapel to be built to replace the original chapel, which\r\n                was now\r\n                too small for the extra congregation. A ruling was make at the time that the new meeting house must not\r\n                be used\r\n                as a burying place for the dead with all burials performed in the graveyard (thence the lack of\r\n                headstones at\r\n                the back of the site today). Yearly donations from the congregation funded the site, Thomas Smith (Queen\r\n                Anne\r\n                House, Lympstone) gave &#163;2 & Joseph Nutt of Lympstone gave 4 shillings in 1733.\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col\">\r\n                <img :src=\"gatesUrl\" class=\"center-fit\"\r\n                     style=\"float:right;margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;max-width:90%\">\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n\r\n             <br><br>In 1786 it was\r\n            decided\r\n            that each person should pay two shillings a year for a pew, records show that some people also paid for\r\n            their\r\n            servant's seating, as well as shares bought by the trustee in the South Sea Stock. This paid for the\r\n            salary of\r\n            the Minister & the building up keep. <br><br>In 1853, the cost of a marriage for a subscriber to the\r\n            chapel was,\r\n            10s 6d for the Minister, 2s each for the Clerk & Sexton. Baptism was 1s for the Minister, 9d for both\r\n            the Clerk\r\n            & Seaton. Burial fee resulting in the Minister getting &#163;1 1s, Clerk & Sexton each getting 2s 6d,\r\n            permission for\r\n            a common grave 10s 6d, permission for a headstone 10s 6d and permission for a tomb with or without a\r\n            rail &#163;3 3s.\r\n            <br><br>Burial at Gulliford include Worthington Brice a merchant who's business comprised of the whaling\r\n            industry based at his home at Parsonage Stile, Margaret & Charles Baring who's family were the banking\r\n            dynasty\r\n            from Courtlands, Brice Wakeford Lee of Ebford Barton a Major-General in the Indian Army, George Mason\r\n            aged just\r\n            25 a talented artist, his work hung in the Royal Academy.\r\n            <br><br>By the end of the 19th century, the laws of dissenters had relaxed, new chapels were built in\r\n            Exmouth &\r\n            Topsham reducing the need to travel so far. The Methodists too had a new chapel, having for years hired\r\n            the\r\n            dis-used Dissenters chapel in Church Road, next to the Redwing (thence the former name The Vaults) and\r\n            where\r\n            Ellenthorpe now stands. The congregation was down to about ten with a minister who cancelled without\r\n            notice, the\r\n            roof was unsafe, repairs neglected and finally in 1907 the chapel was demolished.\r\n            <br><br>Today the burial ground is jointly looked after by Lympstone & Woodbury Parish Councils. The\r\n            perimeter\r\n            walls and the Jervis, the Lees and the Stogdon tombs are Grade II Listed. A notice board informs\r\n            visitors of\r\n            it's past, the site's history hidden behind ivy & yew. A bench welcomes the caller to stop and listen to\r\n            the\r\n            bird song.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <img :src=\"tombUrl\" style=\"max-width:50%\" class=\"center\">\r\n        <br>\r\n        <div class=\"center\">\r\n            References to David Keeper \"Dissent in Woodbury & Lympstone\" 1976 and to the author's own\r\n            research & photos, Angela Coles 2017.\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    export default {\r\n        computed: {\r\n            tombUrl() {\r\n                return require(\"@/assets/images/gallery/10.jpg\");\r\n            },\r\n            gatesUrl() {\r\n                return require(\"@/assets/images/gallery/35.jpg\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n</script>","import { render } from \"./History.vue?vue&type=template&id=7d9e46dc\"\nimport script from \"./History.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./History.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\munkf\\\\Documents\\\\repositories\\\\GraveyardWebsiteInVue\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader-v16\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
