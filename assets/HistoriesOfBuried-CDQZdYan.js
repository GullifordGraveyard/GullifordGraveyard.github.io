Margaret was born around 1743, possibility just a year younger than Charles. Margaret was the daughter of William Drake Gould. Charles and Margaret settle at Courtlands, Withycombe, on the Lympstone boundary. A house set in grounds sweeping down to the bank of the River Exe, with a Ladies Walk a mile long, giving views to the hills beyond. Charles develops the house into an elegant mansion, in line with his social standing.
